# Απομαγνητογράφηση στα Αγγλικά : Christoph Cox – History of Sound Art

00:19:40 έως 00:27:40

For Avant-garde music, but earlier than that actually in Egypt a composer who actually just beginning his
life as a composer Halim El-Dabh begin to compose on a wire recorder that he taken out from Middle
East radio in Cairo, he borrowed i wire recorder and recorded sounds around Cairo the peace that
remains from this, and i play you a short bit of it, is a peace the he recorded at a traditional African, this is
his description of this, a traditional African exorcism a ceremony called Zaar and this a peace called, a
short excerpt of the peace called the ''Expression of Zaar'' these are all, these are largely women's
voices that have been filtered and altered in various ways. So i will foreground one more key moment in
the prehistory of Sound Art. So in 1948 John Cage conceived a plan to compose a four-minuet peace of
uninterrupted silence and to sell it to the muzak corporation, this was his proposal never happened but
anyway, the peace which he called ''Silent Prayer'' was to be he said about three and a half minuets long
because that the length he thought of a short of standard muzak, i don't know how one calls it,
tracks. And but this was never realised but in 1952 he encountered a set of white paintings by his new
friend at that time Robert Rauschenberg, this is a three panel version there a seven panel version i think
a five panel version as well, and these had a tremendous impact at Cage. One could view these
paintings as a kind of ''Degree Zero'' of painting and in fact there a kind of like a pseudo-art joke but
Cage thought of them very differently so Cage said, Cage thought of them as he put it as ''airports for
shadows and for dust'' as ''mirrors of the air'' right, an other he thought what these paintings did was
while removing any image all the incidental things that surround what it is to look at a painting what
surround a plaiting became evident and visible. And so this is what spered Cage to compose what is
certainly his most famous possibly infamous peace 4'33'' which is a peace in three movements at least
initially and calls up on the performer to make no intentional sounds. Cage's peaces often thought of as a
conceptual provocation like Rauschenberg's is thought of a kind of musical joke or at least just a mere
idea right as a reduction of all music to silence but Cage thought of it very differently. For Cage the
peace shifted attention from the foreground of a performance on stage to the background and all the
mired noises that surround us at any given moment the sound of wind, of traffic, of rain the shuffling of
feet the coughing the muttering of people in the audience. And for Cage, Cage thought of this as
constituting a surten kind of music in fact he came to say ''a music more interesting than music mad by
instrumentalists''. This peace is often thought of as a kind a silent peace but as Cage constantly
reminded his readers and interlocutors ''There is no such thing as silence'' he famously said ''There is
not such thing as an empty space or an empty time. The is always something to see, something to hear,
in fact try as we may to make a silence we cannot make silence. Until i die there will be sounds and
continue following my death''. This is an idea that i think really runs through the history of Sound Art, this
idea of sound as a flow that precedes and exceeds human performers, right, to which we contribute our
words, the words we speak the music we make all contribute to that in a what i call a sonic flux but non
the less kinda precedes and exceeds our sound making and this idea i think really runs through out the
history of Sound Art and i think accounts of the prevalence of drones in the history of Sound Art, not
drones not the flying things but the noisy things. So will come across that more later too. Ok, so now to
actually talk about what i am suppose to be talking about which is the history of Sound Art , 4'33'' is the
peace we've been talking about conformed to many of the established conventions of music, even as it
challenges the nature of music the peace is composed in a form of a score for performance by
instrumentalist in a concert setting, there are many ways in which should it short of very much conforms
to the established conventions of music making and performance. In 1966 the celebrated Avant-garde
percussionist Max Neuhaus who is a figure that all the Avant-garde composers called on to play their
work he brought Cage's concept outside of the concert hall and made the first steps toward as we know
as Sound Art, in a project called ''Listen'' Neuhaus would invite audiences to a concert venue, stamp the
word ''Listen'' in their hands and then without saying a word lead them outside the hall through various
urban sound environments of power-plants, highway underpasses, subway stations, short of city street
life all shorts of various environments. Two years later Neuhaus abandoned musical performance for
what he was the first to call ''Sound Installation'' and ll show you one of those in a second, these are
works in which sound is used to mark a particular space and in an interview in 1990 Neuhaus said ''The
most important thing is that in music sound is the work and what i do the sound is the means of making
the work, the means of transforming space into space'' so he thought there to is a kind of Cagian shift
between a kind of foreground and a background where a least a way that sound may have articulating
place or space. Neuhaus begin installing various sound peaces, installation as he called them, in
stairwells, in subway stations in swimming pools in elevators...
